<h2>DIET & NUTRITION</h2>

<h3><p>Food and beverages provide the energy and nutrients you need to improve health, manage disease, and reduce the risk of disease.</p>
<p>Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, staying unrealistically thin, or depriving yourself of the foods you love. 
Rather, it’s about feeling great, having more energy, improving your health, and boosting your mood.</p>
<p>While some extreme diets may suggest otherwise, we all need a balance of protein, fat, carbohydrates, 
fiber, vitamins, and minerals in our diets to sustain a healthy body. </p>
